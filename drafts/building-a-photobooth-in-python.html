    <!-- Intro -->

<p>I'm back from New York where I spent 3 months attending the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, a free,
self-directed educational retreat to become a better programmer. 
<!-- Rewrite intro once I have actual content!!! --></p>
<p>There's these one-day hackathons I go to once in a while. They're called BLT for Build, Learn, Teach. They're not like
traditional hackathons with a theme or specific things to build. People come in in the morning and we have a group
meeting where everyone shares what they want to work on, then people form groups and pair or work on their own stuff.
At the end of the day, people share what they have been working on. Sometimes they built something cool and that works,
sometimes they just spent their day talking about dev stuff or learning about one thing or the other, and that's cool
as well.</p>
<p>When I applied to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, this is how I pictured it. The same kind of
experience, but over 3 months instead of a single day. Turns out this wasn't far from the truth. This is what the
Recurse Center was like, and much more. Here's my try at describing what it was like.</p>
<h2>An unusual experiment</h2>
<!-- same post or split it up? it's ok to decide later -->

<h2>Diversity Counts</h2>
<h2>Great programmers come in all shapes and forms</h2>
<hr />
<p>There's no hierarchy of teaching (everyone has things to teach and things to learn)</p>
<p>You learn best by choosing what to learn.</p>
<p>It's all about the culture baby</p>
<p>A social experiment</p>
<p>The fact it's about programming seems almost tengiential (ortho?). One of my best evenings at RC was when Justin set up
non programming related lightning talks</p>
