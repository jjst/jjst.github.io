    <p>I've been wanting to read <em>Getting Things Done</em>, by David Allen, for a very long time. Getting to the end of it was,
quite ironically, quite hard to get done!</p>
<ul>
<li>Boy was this a tedious read!</li>
<li>It's ok to fall behind on stuff</li>
<li>GTD is the basis (skeleton) of a system. It's no silver bullet. There's no silver bullet!</li>
<li>Summary:</li>
<li>Brain dump (in-tray): keep nothing in your head</li>
<li>Separate the activity of noting down stuff, from organizing, from planning. They're different and require different
    mindsets.</li>
<li>One list of projects. A project is anything that takes more than one physical action to complete. It doesn't have
    to be anything big! e.g., "Get shirt dry-cleaned" is already a project if it involves 1. getting the shirt to the
    dry-cleaner and 2. picking it up at a later point.</li>
<li>For each project, have the next action be clear. The next action needs to be a physical, tangible thing that moves
    the project forward. Use concrete action verbs.
    -&gt; How specific does the next action have to be? It's something that has to be tangible. Is it absolutely obvious
    how to do this action? If not, it might need clarification/splitting. A good rule of thumb might be, if I delegated
    this action to do to a clone of myself that is not aware of what the project is, would they be able to do it?</li>
<li>Regular reviews,</li>
<li>Constraining myself in advance to do a set of fixed tasks with assigned hour doesn't really work. Instead, use tags
    and contexts to know what I can do when (e.g., at work, errands, etc)</li>
<li>What's the place of GTD in the workflow of a "deep worker"? Cal Newport has interesting thoughts regarding this. I
  tend to agree with him. I find GTD still <em>essential</em> and <em>extremely useful</em> even when doing deep work. It's basically
  a way to maximize one's efficiency when doing the necessary shallow work. In the book Allen seems to focus on people
  who do 100% shallow work (managers/execs) and it's a bit unsettling.</li>
</ul>
