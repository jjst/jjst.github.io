Summary: Looking back on the 3 months I spent in New York to become a better programmer

<!--
What is RC
But more importantly: what was it FOR ME.
Deeply connected to why I was doing it.
-->

There's these one-day hackathons I go to once in a while. They're called BLT for Build, Learn, Teach. They're not like
traditional hackathons with a theme or specific things to build. People come in in the morning and we have a group
meeting where everyone shares what they want to work on, then we form groups and pair or work on our own stuff.  At the
end of the day, people who want to share what they have been working on. Sometimes they built something cool, sometimes
they just spent their day talking random programming stuff or learning about one thing or the other, and that's cool as
well.

When I applied to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), this is how I pictured it. The same kind of
experience, but over 3 months instead of a single day.

The premise of RC is pretty simple: you dedicate 3 months to become a better programmer -- whatever that entails is
entirely up to you. You don't have to be an experienced programmer to attend. In my batch, some people hadn't finished
college. Others had 5-10 years of industry experience. Some were people reconverting from law, finance
or arts.

I first heard of RC in an Hacker News headline, 18 months or so ago (RC was still known as [Hacker
School](https://www.recurse.com/blog/77-hacker-school-is-now-the-recurse-center) back then). Though the concept
immediately appealed to me (3 months to finally finish all of the projects I'm always putting off, right?), it took a year
(and a complete burn out) for me to finally apply. Why so long? A mix of [brain
crack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sHCQWjTrJ8) and [impostor
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). The latter isn't uncommon among Recursers, it even gets
mentioned in RC's [user manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment).

During the application process, I talked about spending my batch contributing to open source software, and geeking
around with Haskell and Rust or whatnot. Turns out this was superceded by (or maybe just related to?) a bigger goal,
unbeknownst to me: self-healing.

I've started programming when I was in high school (coding games in TI-BASIC for our calculators with friends) and when
it came time to choose a career, my train of thought was that if I was going to spend 8 hours a day getting paid to do
something, I might as well be enjoying it. Makes sense, right? Except it turns out when you're not careful, full-time
jobs have a tendency to suck the fun out of anything, even what you thought were your passions.

So here I was: after finally applying, and being accepted into a program dedicated to making myself a *better
programmer*, one of the first questions I had to answer when joining RC was whether I still enjoyed *being a
programmer*.

(Spoiler alert: I do)

For me, the Recurse Center meant having the time and freedom to code for myself, with no constraints whatsoever. But
also the freedom to not code when I didn't want to.

This meant I spent pretty much my entire first week helping people and pairing on their own projects or various
Hackerrank or Project Euler problems. A lot of pairing usually happens at RC.

And then I attended some workshops, and I got some new project ideas. I started a project combining some Javascript
rendering with a Flask backend (I've used Python, but had never built anything with Flask before) to generate random
drawings using a genetic algorithm. I started organising weekly code dojos, where people paired on katas using any
language they felt like trying. I got curious about [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and ended up building a
[game](https://github.com/jjst/elmtimate-tictactoe) with it. And then paired on [another
one](https://github.com/mariellefoster/lightsout). And [another one](https://github.com/jjst/dotloverc). By the end of
my batch, I gave a workshop on building web applications and games in Elm, a language I barely knew before.

lights out... built .loverc... ended up giving a workshop on Elm -->

So, when people ask me what I did at the Recurse Center, I can point them to those things. I have stuff to show. But
while there's something gratifying about having built some tangible things to show, I don't want to reduce my
experience to just those. Doing so would not only diminish but also run counter to some of the lessons I learnt at
RC.

I learnt that programmers come in all shapes and forms. Some of us like to understand how computers work in their
inner details, others like higher-level abstractions. Some of us like code as a craft, others like to use code to
get shit done. Some are great at building things, others are great at teaching. And that's awesome. Because there's a
need for all of us. And none of us can be all of those things at the same time. We all have our pockets of knowledge,
with gaps here and there. That might sound obvious, but it's so easy to idealise and extrapolate from the few
famous programmers who seem to know everything and get so many things done, and compare yourself to them. What's
invisible is all the things they fail at or don't know about, like any of us, or the times they're frustrated and
want to give up or don't feel like programming anymore. This also means there's no fixed hierarchy of teaching:
everyone has things to teach and things to learn. This also means don't guilt yourself into not having a blog if you're
not the kind of person who shares their thoughts to the entire world. Don't even guilt yourself if you're struggling to
become a better programmer, or even if you don't want to. That's perfectly fine. Do whatever makes you happy.

I learnt that I can't learn everything I want, even when I can spend 100% of my time doing so, and that I'd better
get used to that fact. This doesn't mean I can't enjoy learning the things I want to. It does mean I don't
have to feel guilty about not spending my time learning all the things I'd like to.

I learnt there's tremendous value in reinventing the wheel. That not everything you build needs to have a purpose other
than "I thought this would be fun to do". Building your own Bittorent client, or web server, or OS, or database, might
be the best way to really understand how those things work.
