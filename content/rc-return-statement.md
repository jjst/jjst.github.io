Summary: Looking back on the 3 months I spent in New York to become a better programmer

There's these one-day hackathons I go to once in a while. They're called BLT for Build, Learn, Teach. They're not like
traditional hackathons with a theme or specific things to build. People come in in the morning and we have a group
meeting where everyone shares what they want to work on, then people form groups and pair or work on their own stuff.
At the end of the day, people share what they have been working on. Sometimes they built something cool and that works,
sometimes they just spent their day talking about dev stuff or learning about one thing or the other, and that's cool
as well.

When I applied to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), this is how I pictured it. The same kind of
experience, but over 3 months instead of a single day. Turns out this wasn't far from the truth. This is what the
Recurse Center was like, and much more.

An unusual experiment
---------------------

I studied software engineering and computer science in college, but admittedly wasn't the best student. I was lucky
enough to enroll in a college where I could choose which courses I enrolled in during the entire curriculum (with some
constraints nonetheless). Despite this, I would often end up struggling and being completely unmotivated (thus failing)
in courses which dabbled in theory but in which I saw no practical application. I just couldn't learn things just
because someone told me that's what I needed to do, if I didn't see the point.

At the Recurse Center, people believe that they learn best when self-motivated. There are no mandatory courses or
activity of any sorts, in fact pretty much nothing is mandatory. When recalling the first day of our batch, a friend
pointed out how surprised they were at how we were left to our own devices as soon as the formalities and introductions
were over.

<!-- This doesn't mean everyone working on their own stuff, in fact this is an inherently social experiment. -->
How does this work out in practice? People pair, organise workshops. Use chat and checkins to discover what they're
working on and help each other. This works because of the culture: if I had to mention one common trait of recurser,
it would be niceness. They've confirmed they select for that during the admission process.

This isn't incompatible with pursuing deep knowledge, though self-direction comes with its own challenges. How do you
find the right project for you? How do you stay focused (big problem expecially with big batches). Over time, people
experiment with things that work, some of them stick (and are even adopted by faculty). Facilitators are available for
guidance, occasional pair program, figure out how to spend your batch. It's also a constantly evolving experiment:
during my batch Rose introduced weekly study groups where people could book a room to do one thing in particular. We
used this to start a group pomodoro experiment.

So what did I learn?

<!-- same post or split it up? it's ok to decide later -->
Great programmers come in all shapes and forms
----------------------------------------------

Remember what Dave said at the intro.

Programming is a super vast domain. People do frontend, backend, other, video games. Some are interested into low
level and OS stuff, some into higher-level, some are into building stuff, some into teaching, some into sharing stuff,
some not. And that's ok.

This means:
There's no hierarchy of teaching (everyone has things to teach and things to learn)

This also means:
Don't guilt yourself into not having a blog if you're not the kind of person who shares their thoughts to the entire
world.

In fact don't even guilt yourself if you're struggling to become a better programmer, or even don't want to. That's
perfectly fine.


Diversity Counts

You learn best by choosing what to learn.

It's all about the culture baby

The fact it's about programming seems almost tengiential (ortho?). One of my best evenings at RC was when Justin set up
non programming related lightning talks
